<h1>
Barcelona say only contact over Adrien Rabiot has been with PSG 
</h1>
<detail>
Barcelona have issued a statement denying they have breached any rules regarding the possible signing of PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot.</br></br>


Rabiot's current contract expires in the summer - meaning he can negotiate a move</br></br>
 to a non-French club for next season once the January transfer window has opened.</br></br></br>
The 23-year-old has been linked with Premier League sides Arsenal and Liverpool, </br></br>
but reports have emerged suggesting he has an agreement in place with Spanish champions Barcelona.</br></br></br></br>

However, Barca released a statement on Sunday which said: "FC Barcelona wish to address stories published in France </br></br>
regarding the signing of players from Paris Saint-Germain, and make clear that they have not breached any rule in this regard.</br></br></br>
"The only contact made was during the month of August and one week ago.</br></br></br>
"In both cases, this contact was made with PSG's sporting management, to show FC Barcelona's interest in player Adrien Rabiot.</br></br></br>
"FC Barcelona have always wanted to work with the utmost transparency in their dealings with PSG and with any other club.</br></br></br>
"FC Barcelona refute the existence of any type of agreement with PSG player Adrien Rabiot."</br></br></br>

The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División,</br><br>
commonly known as La Liga (La Liga Santander for sponsorship reasons with Santander),</br><br>
is the men's top professional football division of the Spanish football league system.</br><br>
Administered by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (English: National Professional Football League), </br><br>
also known as the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP), La Liga is contested by 20 teams,</br><br>
with the three lowest-placed teams relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams in that division plus the winner of a play-off. </br><br>
62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine teams have been crowned champions,</br><br>
with Real Madrid winning the title a record 33 times and Barcelona 25 times. </br><br>
Barcelona won the inaugural La Liga in 1929 with Athletic Bilbao claiming several titles in the league's early years. </br><br>
Barcelona and Real Madrid dominated the championship in the 1950s, winning four La Liga titles each throughout the decade. </br><br>
Real Madrid dominated La Liga from the 1960s through the 1980s, when Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, </br><br>
and Real Sociedad won the league twice in those years. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning 15 titles.</br><br>
Although Real Madrid has been prominent, winning 8 titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Atlético Madrid, Valencia, </br><br>
and Deportivo de La Coruña. In the 2010s, Atlético Madrid has become an increasingly stronger team, forming a trio alongside Real Madrid and Barcelona. </br><br>
According to UEFA's league coefficient, </br><br>
La Liga has been the top league in Europe over the last five years and has led Europe for more years (21) than any other country.</br><br>
It has also produced the continent's top-rated club more times (21) than any other league, more than double that of second-placed Serie A.</br><br>
Its clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (18), UEFA Europa League (11), UEFA Super Cup (15), and FIFA Club World Cup (7) titles, </br><br>
and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (22), </br><br>
The Best FIFA Men's Player including FIFA World Player of the Year (19) and UEFA Men's Player of the Year including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year (11). </br><br>
La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world, with an average attendance of 26,983 for league matches in the 2017–18 season. </br><br>
This is the sixth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world,</br><br>
behind the Bundesliga, and the Premier League.</br><br>
The top 4 teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League Group Stage. </br><br>
The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League Group Stage. </br><br>
If this means 6 La Liga teams qualify, then the 4th place team in La Liga instead plays in the UEFA Europa League, </br><br>
as any single nation is limited to a maximum of 5 teams. </br><br>
The 5th place team in La Liga qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League Group Stage. </br><br>
The winner of the Copa del Rey also qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League Group Stage, </br><br>
but if the winner also finished in the top 5 places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished 6th in La Liga. </br><br>
Furthermore the 6th place (or 7th if 6th already qualifies) team qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League 2nd Qualifying Round. </br><br>
The number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients,</br><br>
 which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous 5 years. </br><br>
Currently the ranking of Spain (and de facto La Liga) is 1st. </br></br>

Pep : City have title winning numbers 
</h1>
<detail>

Pep Guardiola has defended Manchester City's title credentials despite back-to-back defeats handing Liverpool the initiative at the top of the Premier League.


Guardiola's champions endured a miserable Christmas as they were shocked by Crystal Palace and Leicester, </br> 
surrendering the lead in both matches to make it three defeats in four following a loss to Chelsea earlier in December.</br>

Unbeaten Liverpool took full advantage to make Thursday's meeting between the two clubs, live on Sky Sports,</br>
 in Manchester a must-win game for Guardiola's side.</br>

  </br>

Before then City head to Southampton on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, needing to get themselves back on track,</br>
 having slipped to third place behind Tottenham in the table.</br></br>

During a poor run which has coincided with an injury to key midfielder Fernandinho, </br>
City have looked well short of the side that earned a record 100 points last season, but Guardiola sees a team still capable of defending their title.</br></br>

"We did well so far," he said. "We got 44 points in the first round. </br>
If you get the same number of points in the second round, that's 88 points. With 88 points, you are champions. You have the numbers to be champions.</br>

</br>
Highlights from Leicester's 2-1 win over Manchester City</br>
"Most of the Premier League champions in the past 20 years won it with less points. We did quite well. We did really well.</br>
</br>
"But of course you have the past two games, against Crystal Palace and Leicester, </br>
and you have that sense, because there are two teams there now who are better than us in the last month.</br>
</br>

"What can we say when Liverpool keep nine clean sheets and score a lot of goals? We cannot compete with that in terms of comparing with them.</br>

"So we look at ourselves, and tomorrow against Southampton, we have to do what we do, and try to win, </br>
and when that happens, everything comes back to a normal position."
</br>

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says his team still believe they can return to their best despite losing their last two Premier League games</br>
Guardiola is well known for refusing to budge from his tactical approach and laughed when he was asked if he thought he might need to now.</br>

"Oh, I was waiting for that question," he said. "I was waiting for it later. That is not going to happen. </br>
It did not happen in the first year, it is not going to happen.</br>
</br>
"Why should I? Because I lost two games? No way. It is definitely not going to happen."</br>

<h1> Premier League : </h1>
<detail>
The Premier League (often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL) </br> <br>
 outside England) is the top level of the English football league system.</br><br>
 Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). </br><br>

 The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border league.</br><br>
The competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the </br><br>
Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, </br><br>
and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.</br><br>
 The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, </br><br>
with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.</br><br>
The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.</br><br>
 In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion, rising sharply to £2.4 billion in 2016–17. </br><br>
The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to </br><br>
643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.</br><br>
 In the 2014–15 season, the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000,</br><br>
 second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga's 43,500.</br><br>
 Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.</br><br>
 The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances</br><br>
 in European competitions over the past five seasons, as of 2018.</br><br>
Forty-nine clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. </br><br>
Six of them have won the title since then: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3),</br><br>
 Manchester City (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), and Leicester City (1). </br><br>
The record of most points in a Premier League season is 100 by Manchester City in 2017–18.</br><br>

<h1> Serie A: </h1> </br>
<detail>
Serie A , also called Serie A TIM due to sponsorship by TIM,</br><br>
 is a professional league competition for football clubs located at the top of the Italian football league system </br><br>
and the winner is awarded the Coppa Campioni d'Italia. It has been operating for over eighty years since the 1929–30 season.</br><br>
 It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010, when the Lega Serie A was created for the 2010–11 season. </br><br>
Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical national league.</br><br>
 Serie A was the world's second-strongest national league in 2014 according to IFFHS Italian clubs have reached the final of the competition on 27 occasions, </br><br>
winning the title 12 times. Serie A is ranked third among European leagues according to UEFA's league coefficient,</br><br>
 behind La Liga, Premier League, and ahead of Bundesliga the Ligue 1, which is based on the performance of Italian clubs</br><br>
in the Champions League and the Europa League during the last five years.Serie A led the UEFA ranking from 1986 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1999.</br><br>
In its current format, the Italian Football Championship was revised from having regional and interregional rounds,</br><br>
 to a single-tier league from the 1929–30 season onwards. The championship titles won prior to 1929 are officially </br><br>
recognised by FIGC with the same weighting as titles that were subsequently awarded. However, the 1945–46 season, </br><br>
when the league was played over two geographical groups due to the ravages of WWII, is not statistically considered, </br><br>
even if its title is fully official.All the winning teams are recognised with the title of Campione d'Italia ("Champion of Italy"), </br><br>
which is ratified by the Lega Serie A before the start of the next edition of the championship. </br><br>
The league hosts three of the world's most famous clubs as Juventus, Milan and Internazionale, all founding members of the G-14, </br><br>
a group which represented the largest and most prestigious European football clubs from 2000 to 2008,</br><br>
being the first two cited also founding members of its successive organisation, European Club Association (ECA). </br><br>
More players have won the coveted Ballon d'Or award while playing at a Serie A club than any league in the world other than Spain's La Liga.</br><br>
 although Spain's La Liga has the highest total number of Ballon d'Or winners. </br><br>
Juventus, Italy's most successful club of the 20th century and the most successful Italian team,</br><br>
 is tied for fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most official international titles. </br><br>
The club is also the only one in the world to have won all possible official confederation competitions.</br><br>
Milan is joint third club for official international titles won in the world, with 18. Internazionale, </br><br>
following their achievements in the 2009–10 season, became the first Italian team to have achieved a treble. </br><br>
Inter are also the only team in Italian football history to have never been relegated. Juventus, Milan and Inter, </br><br>
along with Roma, Fiorentina, Lazio and Napoli, are known as the Seven Sisters of Italian football.</br><br>
Serie A is one of the most storied football leagues in the world. Of the 100 greatest footballers in history chosen by FourFourTwo magazine in 2017, </br><br>
42 players have played in Serie A, more than any other league in the world. Juventus is the team that has produced the most World Cup champions (25),</br><br>
 with Inter (19), Roma (15) and Milan (10), being respectively third, fourth and ninth in that ranking. <br>

<h1> Tottenham have a chance against Borussia Dortmund if they are at their best, says Danny Mills.  </h1>
 </br> </br> 

<detail>
Danny Mills thinks Tottenham's Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund is "difficult but winnable".</br></br>
The German side are enjoying an impressive season and have opened up a nine-point lead in the Bundesliga after 15 games.</br></br>
They won their Champions League group and will face Spurs next year, with the first leg in England on February 13, </br></br>
before the sides square off at the Westfalenstadion on March 5.</br></br>
Spurs beat Dortmund twice in the group stages of the tournament last season but former England man</br></br>
 Mills told Sky Sports: "It has been a better performance from Dortmund this season, they are playing well.</br></br>
"Attractive football, a high tempo - they will be very difficult to play against, especially with the second leg in Dortmund,</br></br>
 with their fans and the yellow wall, the backing that the crowd gives them there.</br>
</br></br>
"It is going to be very difficult for Tottenham, but it is winnable still, you don't look at it as an impossible task.</br></br>
"On their day, Tottenham can be outstanding.</br></br>
"If they play to their very best, they have got a great chance of still going through."</br></br>
